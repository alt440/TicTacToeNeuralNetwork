# TicTacToeNeuralNetwork

Creating an AI using the reinforcement machine learning process. 

A class is made for a normal tic tac toe game. It is made to understand how a normal 2 player tic tac toe game.

Another class is made to get the data set of all possible scenarios in a tic tac toe game. These scenarios will then be associated with a number from 0 to 1, where 1 is the most favorable and 0 the least favorable position of the AI. 

A third class is made to train the AI. It will train the AI with itself to start determining the values associated with the different scenarios.

A final class is made to play against the AI.

I used a report from someone else's project, which is given as a pdf in the repository.
